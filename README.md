# React Quiz

##### First of all, it was fun building this game!

I know it is not perfect, but hey, I'm pretty new to React.
I did my best to try and figure out how to work with Redux, so I run out of time to write some tests and other stuff I wanted.

I think it's a bit messy, the structure, the missing tests, the css rules, the missing linter & types.
But it's working pretty well `also on mobile` and it's just a test (there's a limit of how much time I can invest in that)

There is a `HINT` button that is actually a `CHEAT` button to put the right answer in the textarea (just to make it simple to play around and test the functionality)

### Development server

- Run `npm install`

- Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.


### Running tests

Run `npm test` to execute the tests.

> There is only one test at the moment, the default one from `create-react-app`, I just fixed it to work with the Redux store.

#### Enjoy :smile:
